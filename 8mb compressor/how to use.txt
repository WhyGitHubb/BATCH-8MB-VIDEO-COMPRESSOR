step 1 - Open "get video time.bat" and  paste your video path or drag the video in the window
step 2 - Now copy the the Number that is printed in the terminal 
step 3 - Calculate the bitrate go to Calculate.txt and calculate it in a calculator
step 4 - Copy the result of the calculated bitrate
step 5 - Open compress.bat, put video file, the calculated bitrate, and your output file name with file extention that you want (.mp4 .mov etc.)
step 6 - Wait, after that you should see "done!" you can close the window. The Compressed video should be the same as this parent folder.
step 7 - Now you can actually send shit on discord because its below 8 mb enjoy!

some notes:
- You can toy around with the bitrate increase or decrease it and adjust the quality 
- This supports various types of video formats with also the option to export a different video format thanks to ffmpeg.
- This is really an inconvenient way to do it, lot of steps and shit but honestly better than those online video compressors
